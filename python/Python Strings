###Python Strings#####

#Strings are simply the most popular types in Python.We can simply create them by closing them in single or double quotes.

str1 = 'Hello world'
str2 = "Hello Python"

#Python does not support a character type; these are treated as strings of length one, thus also considered a substring.

print (str1)
print (str2)

#String formating operator:-One of Python's coolest features is the string format operator %.

# print ('my name is %s and my hieght is %d inches') % ('Bunty' , 6)

##Multiline strings can be written in triple quotes:

multistr = """Google is an American multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products that 
include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, software, and hardware."""

print (multistr)

####Python string funtions#####################

#1)capitalize()   =>It returns a copy of the string with only its first character capitalized.

strs = 'this is python'
print (strs.capitalize())

#2)count(sub , start = 0 , end = length(string)))  =>The method count() returns the number of occurrences of substring sub in the range [start, end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.

string = 'This is google and its a technology company'

sub = 'i'
print (string.count(sub , 0 , 40))

#3)find()  =>It determines if string str occurs in string, or in a substring of string if starting index beg and ending index end are given.

str = 'That interview was very difficult'
str1 = 'dif'
print (str.find(str1))
print (str.find(str1 , 0 , 20))

print (str.isdigit())    # will return false because str has no digits

strings = '123455'
print (strings.isdigit())    # will return true becuase it has only digits
str = "THIS is string example....wow!!!"; 
print (str.islower())

str = "this is string example....wow!!!";
print (str.islower())

#4) join()  =>The method join() returns a string in which the string elements of sequence have been joined by str separator.

str = '-'
sequence = ("This" , "is" , "Python")
print (str.join(sequence))

# Above command will return This-is-python

#5)len()  => This method will return the length of the string

string = 'This is my strings'
print ('The length of the string is : ' , len(string))

#6) lower() => This method will return the string in lower case letter

string = 'CONVERT THIS STRING INTO LOWER CASE'

print ('String in lower case : ' , string.lower())

#7)max()  =>  The method max() returns the max alphabetical character from the string str.

string = 'Yes really python is good and m gonna master in it'
print (max(string))

#8)min()  => Returns the min alphabetical character from the string str.

sting = 'absjasjkaskjakjs'
print (min(sting))

#9)replace(old , new ,[max])  => The method replace() returns a copy of the string in which the occurrences of old have been replaced with new, optionally restricting the number of replacements to max.

str3 = 'this is string example , wow this is really string'
print (str3.replace('is' , 'was' ))
print (str3.replace('is' , 'was' , 2))

#10)split() => This method returns the string after splitting

str4 = 'This is my work and ,  I am gonna succedd in this'

print (str4.split())  #> By default it is splited by space
print (str4.split(','))  # This will split by the delimiter command
