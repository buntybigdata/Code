#####The job tool allows you to create and work with saved jobs. Saved jobs remember the parameters used to specify a job, so they 
can be re-executed by invoking the job by its handle.

1)Create a new job:-

sqoop job --create sqoop_job \
  --  import \
  --connect "jdbc:mysql://quickstart.cloudera:3306/retail_db" \
  --username=retail_dba \
  --password=cloudera \
  --table departments \
  --target-dir /user/hive/warehouse/retail_ods.db/departments \
  --append \
  --fields-terminated-by '|' \
  --lines-terminated-by '\n' \
  --check-column "department_id" \
  --incremental append \
  --last-value 7 \

Please not that there must be space between -- and import in the above command.

#####If you want to check the available sqoop jobs , below is the command  for  that:

      Sqoop job  - - list
      
#####And if you want to see the details about any sqoop job , below is the command for that:

#####And if you want to execute the sqoop job following below the command:
